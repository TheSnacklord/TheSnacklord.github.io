      <span style="color: antiquewhite;"> We worked in a group of five people to complete this project and we used MatPlotLib to solve it. We also had to export the graphs data to another file. I was the primary programmer. Here is the problem description from the presentation slide show.
         We needed to graph and explicit and implicit heat equation solution for the copper wire, full slideshow available on request</span>

      <span style="color: antiquewhite;">This is the explicit solution to the problem and is graphed using MatPlotLib</span>
