      <span style="color: antiquewhite;"> We worked in a group of five people to complete this project and we used MatPlotLib to solve it. We also had to export the graphs data to another file. I was the primary programmer. Here is the problem description from the presentation slide show.
         We needed to graph and explicit and implicit heat equation solution for the copper wire, full slideshow available on request</span>
      <img src="1.png" alt="explicit" style="width:100%; padding-top: 20px;">
      <span style="color: antiquewhite;">This is the explicit solution to the problem and is graphed using MatPlotLib</span>
      <img src="2.png" alt="implicit" style="width:100%; padding-top: 20px;">
      <span style="color: antiquewhite;">This is the implicit (or approximated) solution to the problem and is also graphed using MatPlotLib</span>
      <img src="3.png" alt="code" style="width:100%; padding-top: 20px;">
      <span style="color: antiquewhite;">Example of input and code which made it easier to test quickly(although it is broken now). The full code is available on my Github under 'ME1600/project2'. There is also the printed data files there as well.</span>
